## 📊 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning missing or inconsistent values
   - Normalization and feature scaling
   - Domain-specific feature engineering

2. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Unsupervised models (e.g., Isolation Forest)
   - Distance-based and density-based techniques
   - Threshold-based anomaly scoring

3. **Evaluation**
   - Statistical validation
   - Visualization of anomaly distributions
   - Comparison across multiple models

## 🔮 Future Work

- Incorporation of temporal and behavioral features
- Model explainability (e.g., SHAP values)
- Integration with real-time detection pipelines
- Expansion to multi-year and cross-regional datasets
